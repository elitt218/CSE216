Hi Prof Femmister, Prof Razavi, and any other assorted TA's grading this
assignment!

For this project we've created an interface allowing users to create Exam events
and store them to the database.

Please make sure the following libraries are installed before compiling this
program:

Needs to be manually installed:
- Swingx-0.9.5.jar (For the nice, pretty calendar dropdown)
- mysql-connector-java-5.1.40-bin.jar 

Included in NetBeans:
- junit-4.12.jar (Required for unit testing)
- hamcrest-core-1.3.jar (Required for unit testing)

The two unit testing libraries are built into Netbeans. We've included the other
two libraries in the folder "/proj/cse216-git/Group9/Required Libraries", because
NetBeans doesn't like including Libraries in Git Repos.
